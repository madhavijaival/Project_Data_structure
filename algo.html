  <!-- *****Here <def> element used for the defination of algorithm ********-->
            <p>
              An<dfn id="def-algorithm"> algorithm</dfn> is a collection of
              instructions or rules that must be followed by a computer in order
              for it to perform calculations or other problem-solving tasks.
              According to its formal definition, an algorithm is a finite
              collection of instructions that are executed in a precise order to
              perform a job. It is not the whole program or code; rather, it is
              a solution (logic) to a problem that may be expressed informally
              using a Flowchart or Pseudocode.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Problem: A problem might be a real-world problem or an example
                of a real-world problem for which we need to develop a program
                or set of instructions. An algorithm is the collection of
                instructions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Algorithm: For an issue that requires a step-by-step method, an
                algorithm will be created.
              </li>
              <li>
                Input: After developing an algorithm, the algorithm is given the
                needed and desirable inputs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Processing unit: The input will be sent to the processing unit,
                which will then generate the desired output.
              </li>
              <li>Output: The output is the program's outcome or result.</li>

            <h3>Types of Algorithm</h3>
            <p>The following are the types of algorithm:</p>

              </li>
              <p>
                Every day, we look for something in our daily lives. Similarly,
                in the case of a computer, large amounts of data are kept in the
                memory, and when a user requests information, the computer looks
                for that information in the memory and returns it to the user.
                To search the data in an array, you can use one of two methods:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Linear search</li>
                <li>Binary search</li>
              </ul>
              <br />

              <li>
                <b><em>Sorting Algorithms:</em></b>
              </li>

              <p>
                Sorting algorithms are used to rearrange the items of an array
                or a specific data structure in either ascending or descending
                order. The element's new order is determined by the comparison
                operator.
