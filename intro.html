            <p>
              Data Structure is a collection of data components that provides an
              effective method of storing and organizing data in a computer so
              that it may be used efficiently. Examples of Data Structures
              include Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and other Data
              Structures. Data Structures are utilized in nearly every element
              of computer science, including operating systems, compiler design,
              artificial intelligence, graphics, and many more.
            </p>

            <p>
              Data Structures are essential components of many computer science
              methods because they allow programmers to manage data in an
              effective manner. It is critical in improving the performance of a
              software or program since the primary job of the software is to
              save and retrieve the user's data as quickly as feasible.

              <dt>Processor speed:</dt>
              <dd>
                High-speed processing is necessary to manage very huge amounts
                of data, however when data grows to billions of files per entity
                on a daily basis, processors may fail to handle that much data.
              </dd>
              <dt>Data Search:</dt>
              <dd>
                Consider a store with an inventory of 106 goods. If our program
                has to search for a certain item, it must traverse 106 items
                every time, which slows down the search process.
